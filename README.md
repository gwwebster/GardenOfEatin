## Garden of Eatin

## Description
This is a basic application built using React for a (not real) restaurant, Garden of Eatin. The app has several components, all linked using React Router: a homepage, menu, about section, and a (controlled) form for users to submit new dishes.

## Usage
The application fetches menu data from a json-server (see json-server-garden-of-eatin repo) on initial render and posts new dish data to the server when a user submits the form.
